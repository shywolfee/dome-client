## Local Windows launcher

From the repository folder, double-click `run domeclient.bat`. It installs dependencies on first run, creates a local `.env` from `.env-example-local` when needed, builds the browser bundle, and starts the client. Open the local URL printed by the server.

The multi-MUD connect screen includes a bundled directory of active/recently reachable games from mu*index, MUDVerse, and MudStats. mu*index entries include measured language and charset metadata where available; selecting one applies its default encoding, including GBK/Big5, EUC-KR, and KOI8-R language defaults. TopMUDSites, MUDConnect, and the unreliable TheMUDs.org listing are not used.

Dome Client is the maintained successor to the [Legacy Dome Client](https://github.com/javaChilly/dome-client.js), with ongoing fixes, modernized dependencies, a developer IDE for editing MOO verbs & properties, and expanded documentation.

It is a browser-based MUD client built with Node.js, Express, and Socket.io. It bridges browser WebSocket connections to traditional telnet-based MUD servers, so players can connect without installing anything.

## Attribution

This project is a fork of [SindomeCorp/dome-client](https://github.com/SindomeCorp/dome-client), which in turn follows the earlier [Legacy Dome Client](https://github.com/javaChilly/dome-client.js). The fork preserves the original BSD 3-Clause licensing and attribution. Directory metadata is collected from the sources documented in the bundled data and refresh script.

## Differences in This Fork

This fork extends the original [SindomeCorp/dome-client](https://github.com/SindomeCorp/dome-client) for general-purpose multi-MUD use:

- Supports connections to arbitrary MUD hosts and ports instead of a single configured game.
- Adds a bundled directory of 841 deduplicated, currently reachable or recently confirmed MUDs from mu*index, MUDVerse, and MudStats.
- Adds clickable directory links with search and language filtering, including Chinese, English, German, Italian, Korean, Polish, Russian, Spanish, and unknown-language listings.
- Adds MSSP option-70 checks beside directory entries, a progressive MSSP directory scan, and filters for MUDs declaring values such as players, rooms, areas, races, and other MSSP variables.
- Adds explicit and automatic encoding support for UTF-8, GBK/GB18030, Big5, EUC-KR/CP949, Shift-JIS, EUC-JP, KOI8-R/KOI8-U, CP866, Windows code pages, and ISO-8859-1.
- Applies per-MUD encoding defaults from directory metadata and remembers manually selected encodings per host and port.
- Excludes stale directory sources such as TheMUDs.org, TopMUDSites, and MUDConnect.
- Improves command delivery with ordered socket writes, byte-accurate command encoding, connection checks, and acknowledgements.
- Includes `run domeclient.bat` for local Windows setup, building, server startup, readiness checking, and browser launch.

The directory can be refreshed with `scripts/refresh-mud-directory.mjs`. Directory data is bundled locally so the connect page remains usable without live directory requests.

## Single-MUD Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shywolfee/dome-client.git
cd dome-client
npm i
cp .env-example-local .env
npm start
```
Open in Browser: http://localhost:8080

This mode uses your configured `MUD_HOST`/`MUD_PORT` as the fixed game to connect to.
Set `MUD_TLS_ENABLED=true` only when that configured MUD endpoint supports TLS; the backend connection will use Node's normal certificate verification.

## Multi-MUD Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shywolfee/dome-client.git
cd dome-client
npm i
cp .env-example-local .env
```

Set the following in `.env`:

```env
MULTI_MUD=true
MUD_HOST=default-game-if-user-does-not-enter-one.com
MUD_PORT=default-port
# Optional: expose the per-connection TLS checkbox and honor transport_mode=tls links.
MUD_TLS_ENABLED=false
```

Then start:

```bash
npm start
```

Open in Browser: http://localhost:8080

In this mode, the splash page is host/port-first and users can connect to different games; successful connections are tracked in persisted multi-MUD metrics.
Set `MUD_TLS_ENABLED=true` to expose an optional **Use TLS** connection choice for users. Plain TCP remains the default for each new host/port.

## Planned Improvements

These are tracked goals for the fork:

- [ ] Proper mobile support across phone and tablet screen sizes, including touch-friendly terminal interaction.
- [ ] An Electron desktop application with a packaged local runtime.
- [ ] MSSP integration for live player counts and other server-status readouts.
- [ ] Opt-in live directory updates from the mu*index API, with local bundled data remaining available as a fallback.
- [ ] More automated reachability checks and directory refresh reporting.
- [ ] More complete per-MUD language and encoding metadata.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- npm

## Terminology

`MUD` is the generic product and runtime term in Dome Client. `MOO` is retained for MOO-specific protocol behavior, editor language support, status-route compatibility such as `/moo/status/`, and legacy internal config object names. Environment variables, routes, data files, storage keys, and public docs links keep their existing names for compatibility.

## Features

- Browser-based MUD play over WebSocket with no installation.
- Optional explicit TLS for backend MUD connections via `MUD_TLS_ENABLED`.
- Two connection modes:
  - Single-MUD mode (`MULTI_MUD=false`): fixed game from `MUD_HOST`/`MUD_PORT`.
  - Multi-MUD mode (`MULTI_MUD=true`): user enters host/port to enter connect flow with persisted per-game metrics.
- Terminal-accurate ANSI rendering with a stateful parser (including reset/inverse handling), full Xterm256 support, and TrueColor (`38;2`/`48;2`) foreground/background rendering in both live output and exported logs.
- HTTPS support.
- Automatic URL linkification in output buffer.
- Inline media previews for image/video/YouTube links with expand/collapse toggles.
- Host/IP enrichment for `[host=...]` tokens, with clickable IP/hostname lookup links.
- Copy-friendly wrapping for `#obj` and `$ref`-style tokens in buffer output.
- Regex-based client alerts with optional sound/window attention on match.
- Connection safety UX: disconnect overlay with one-click reconnect, unload warning while connected, and graceful `@quit` on page exit.
- Live health panel with hover/click detail view and rolling CPU/RAM/user charts (when status service is configured).
- Input ergonomics: command history recall, long-input-friendly arrow behavior, and keyboard shortcuts (`Pause/Break`, `Home`, `Insert`, `Ctrl+R`).
- Command history search overlay (`Ctrl+R`) with live filtering, de-duplicated exact matches, keyboard navigation, and one-key insert back into the input buffer.
- Mobile-focused UX: plain-text keyboard hints for command entry (no autocorrect/caps), dedicated up/down history buttons, responsive input sizing, touch-friendly action toolbar, centered overlay dialogs, and guarded clear-buffer confirmation.
- Rich client options: command hints, local echo, image preview, overlay transparency, buffer size, alert sound, font/theme choices, editor mode selection, separate input/output font sizing, configurable input text/background colors, and `Scroll Up to Pause` autoscroll behavior.
- Optional Screen Reader Mode: preserves the visible terminal and existing live region while removing ANSI/control and decorative terminal noise from new accessible output and announcing prompts after nearby output.
- Client options Import/Export workflow: download all preferences as JSON, import recognized keys locally, validate ranges, normalize legacy values, and reset to defaults with explicit confirmation.
- Session log export as HTML for preserving and sharing scrollback, with a client option to switch between default self-contained inline CSS and a lighter legacy linked stylesheet mode.
- Better nowrap output handling via SDWC markers (`SDWC-START-NOWRAP` / `SDWC-END-NOWRAP`) and a mobile-friendly wrap option for long horizontal content.
- Built-in keyboard shortcuts for both client and IDE workflows.
- Optional URL-shortener integration.
- Optional status-service integration.
- Native bridge integration support (`window.DomeBridge` / `window.DomeNative`) for mobile wrappers, including queued startup event handling and native log-download routing when available.
- Fully bundled client styling (local LESS/CSS and glyph assets), removing runtime dependency on external `dome.css` for consistent mobile/desktop rendering.
- Optional multi-game landing mode (`MULTI_MUD`) with host/port-first connect flow and persisted per-game connection metrics.
- MSSP directory checks from the multi-MUD landing page. Individual **Check MSSP** buttons query a game through the server, while **Load MSSP directory** checks the bundled entries progressively. Once results are loaded, the MSSP filter can show all detected MSSP games or games declaring a specific variable. MSSP checks use the standard Telnet option 70 negotiation and do not send login commands.

## Connection Modes

### Single-MUD Mode (`MULTI_MUD=false`)

- Intended for game-specific deployments where the client should always connect to one configured game.
- Splash and metadata are game-name centric (`MUD_NAME` is shown in heading/copy).
- Backend socket connections use `MUD_HOST` and `MUD_PORT` directly.
- `MUD_TLS_ENABLED=true` makes every backend MUD connection use TLS; URL query parameters do not override this mode.

### Multi-MUD Mode (`MULTI_MUD=true`)

- Intended for hub/public client deployments where users choose host/port at connect time.
- Splash switches to generic **Play Now** with a host/port connect form.
- Client passes selected host/port to the backend per connection.
- `MUD_HOST`/`MUD_PORT` still serve as fallback defaults for empty/invalid user input.
- Missing or invalid selected ports, including values below `23`, fall back to `MUD_HOST`/`MUD_PORT`.
- When `MUD_TLS_ENABLED=true`, the splash form shows a per-host **Use TLS** checkbox and direct URLs may include `transport_mode=tls`.
- Direct `transport_mode=tls` URLs are honored only when both `MULTI_MUD=true` and `MUD_TLS_ENABLED=true`; otherwise they connect with plain TCP.
- Successful connections are counted and persisted across restarts in `data/multi-mud-metrics.json`.
- The connection stats list tracks TCP and TLS separately for the same host and port, and TLS rows link back with `transport_mode=tls`.

Example direct multi-MUD TLS URL:

```text
/player-client/?gh=secure.example.org&gp=6697&transport_mode=tls
```

## IDE Features

- Built-in IDE editor for verb and property editing, including multi-tab editing workflows.
- Object Browser and Property Browser panes in the IDE for fast navigation across loaded objects.
- Ctrl/Cmd-click code navigation in the IDE (`@edit` target jumps), with optional parent-chain lookup support.
- Hover overlays in the IDE for verb/property metadata lookups via SDWC out-of-band commands.
- Optional VMS note workflow for program saves (can append a commit-style note line after `@program` saves).
- Optional MOO parser diagnostics for verb editors, with a deployment flag to block `@program` saves while parser errors are visible.
- Scratch pad workflow (`@scratch` / `@edit me.scratch`) for temporary editing and recall.
- Optional individual editor-window mode (non-IDE) with unsaved-change protection.

Optional IDE integrations can be disabled per deployment when the connected MOO does not support their command flows. See [docs/ide-editor.md](docs/ide-editor.md) for the related environment flags.

## Installation

1. Install system dependencies (Ubuntu example):
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y nodejs npm git supervisor
   ```
2. Clone the repository and install npm packages:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SindomeCorp/dome-client.git
   cd dome-client
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy `.env-example-local` (for local/dev) or `.env-example-production` (for production) to `.env` and adjust for your environment.
   - For MOO-side integration, see [docs/MOO-SETUP.md](docs/MOO-SETUP.md)
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. Connect in your browser to the NODE_SOCKET_URL defined in your .env. For example: http://localhost:8080

### Supervisor Deployment

The repository ships with [`supervisor.conf`](supervisor.conf) for managing the process via Supervisor on Ubuntu. Link it into Supervisor's configuration directory and reload:

```bash
sudo ln -s "$(pwd)/supervisor.conf" /etc/supervisor/conf.d/dome-client.conf
sudo supervisorctl reread
sudo supervisorctl update
```

After linking, manage the service with `sudo supervisorctl start dome-client`, `sudo supervisorctl restart dome-client`, etc. Adjust the paths inside `supervisor.conf` if the repository lives somewhere other than `/opt/dome-client`.

## Running without Supervisor

Start the application:

```bash
node src/server.js
```

To run it in the background:

```bash
sudo nohup node src/server.js &
```

On production systems, SSL certificates are typically readable only by root. Start the server with `sudo` so Node can access the key files.

## Project Structure

All application code resides in `src/` and follows a layered design:

- `src/server.js` starts the Express application.
- `src/config/` builds configuration objects from environment variables.
- `src/routes/` maps HTTP routes to controllers.
- `src/controllers/` handle request and response logic.
- `src/services/` contain reusable domain logic.
- `src/middleware/` contains middleware helpers (for example error and LESS middleware).
- `src/logger.js` exposes a shared Winston logger.
- `src/env.js` defines and validates environment variables.
- View templates live in `views/`; see [`views/README.md`](views/README.md) for directory layout and templating guidelines.

Controllers may depend on services and configuration, but services remain independent of Express. Tests live in `test/` and mirror this structure.

## IP Block List

Set `IP_BLOCKLIST_PATH` to a plain-text file to reject exact client IPs before serving web pages, static assets, or Socket.io connections. Leave it empty to disable blocking. The file is loaded when the web client starts, accepts one IP per line, and ignores blank lines or `#` comments. Invalid entries are logged and skipped.

When `NODE_SOCKET_PROXIED=true`, block-list checks use the left-most `X-Forwarded-For` address for both HTTP and Socket.io requests. Enable that only behind a trusted reverse proxy.

## Editor

The in-browser editor uses [Ace](https://ace.c9.io/) v1.43.2 with a custom MOO mode and optional Vim keybindings. Custom modules live under `src/client/features/editor/ace` and are bundled during the build. Run `npm start` or `npm run build` after editing these modules to regenerate client assets. See [docs/ace-notes.md](docs/ace-notes.md) for details.

## Advanced Setup Guides

### MOO Verbs for Local Editing

If you want the IDE to function properly you'll need to make a few verb changes/additions on your MOO.

## Dealing with port 80 and file permissions

```bash
sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' $(which node)
```

## Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Static Analysis

```bash
npm run deadcode
npm run deadcode:deps
npm run deadcode:exports
npm run deadcode:files
```

Dead-code analysis uses Knip and is configured to scan source, tests, templates, and tooling while ignoring generated assets under `public/`.
